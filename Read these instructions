1) Copy the Clothes folder into the static folder
2) Run python3 app.py
4) Need to install flask
3) Choose to label Tops/Bottoms/Shoes accordingly (your data set contains only one of the three types)

LABELLING INSTRUCTIONS:
- For most clothes, you only need to pick a primary colour, don't need to choose a secondary colour. Unless there is clearly more than one colour (~ >20% of the clothing is of another colour)
- It is ok to leave a category blank if none of the labels are applicable
- If unsure about the label please google
- 


Other notes:
- For t-shirt-style, graphic-text means it has a considerably sized graphic logo or some text printed on it
